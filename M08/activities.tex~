\subsubsection{STM32 code improvements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Now using the external SDRAM.
	\item ST's peripheral library did not allow continuous SPI transfers larger than 65535 bytes.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This was not a problem on low resolutions.
		\item Larger resolutions segmentated a lot and this significantly increases transmission time.
		\item A combination of EXTI+DMA was implemented to allow single-stream SPI transfers of any size.
		\item This required some changes at the signaling protocol.
		\item All this is library-free code (directly modifying the microcontroller's registers).
	\end{itemize}
	\item Found out at the camera's datasheet that it can be overclocked on low resolutions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Computer vision integration}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The integration was finished.
	\item Current software on the Raspberry Pi side does the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Allocates memory to store frames in every processing stage.
		\item Initializes the SPI peripheral.
		\item Signal the STM32 and read a frame from it.
		\item Optionally draws the frame at any processing stage (see figure \ref{fig_line_detection_integration}) using SDL.
		\item Performs Gaussian blurring, Edge detection and Probabilistic Hough Transform.
		\item Discriminates between lines and outputs the angle of the most important one through UART.
		\item All of the above using the laptop's camera (was needed for testing).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stereo vision depth detection}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This opperation needs to be done on the GPU due to time constraints.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is a hevy operation and the CPU could not do it.
		\item An approximate solution needs to be calculated using the GPU.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Raspberry code was started to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Initialize, allocate and communicate with the GPU.
		\item Send the camera frames to the GPU.
		\item Perform custom operations on the frames using shaders.
		\item Draw the output.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
