\subsubsection{DCMI troubleshooting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item When trying to send images to the Raspberry using DMA it was found most data were zeros.
	\item A lot of different software and hardware tests were done to diagnose the problem.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item DCMI interrupts work as expected.
		\item DMA works.
		\item If you disconnect a data pin DMA writes a one (due to STM32's pull-up resistor).
		\item Every signal looks as expected using an oscilloscope.
	\end{itemize}
	\item It seems to be a hardware problem but
\end{itemize}
