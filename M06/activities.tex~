\subsubsection{OV7670 deep exploration}
\begin{itemize}
	\item While trying to find the cause of the DCMI problem the OV7670 chip was studied.
	\item Code to read and write to its internal registers was ported.
	\item Different registers configurations were attempted and used to try to make it easier for the software implementation to sample the data.
	\item Linux drivers' register sets were attempted without any good results.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{DCMI software workaroud}
\begin{itemize}
	\item After trying some new ideas and doing more tests it was decided to attempt to read the camera in software.
	\item The objective was to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read and interpret VSYNC, HREF and PXCLK signals.
		\item Read data lines (D0-D7) at the rising edge of the PXCLK signal if HREF is high and VSYNC is low.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The main problems found while doing this were:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Compiler's optimizations impact results greatly (deleting an unrelated variable would make a difference between the program succeeding/failing).
		\item Impossibility to keep up with the data rate (sampling 8 lines of data in a very short ammount of time).
	\end{itemize}
	\item Pins were reassigned to be on the same port to make it possible to sample all the data with a single volatile read.
	\item Software branches were minimized supported by the new pin assignment and OV7670's register configurations (i.e. there is a mode that makes the PXCLK toggle only if HREF is active).
	\item This allowed to get a low resolution image at 30 fps.
	\item However the image was very noisy.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration with the Raspberry}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Integration was done using the code to read the image in software.
	\item A simple acknowledgment method is used.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two lines were connected between the Raspberry and the STM32.
		\item One is !REQUEST (active-low, Raspberry output, STM32 input) and the other one is !READY (active-low, STM32 output, Raspberry input).
		\item When the raspberry wants the next camera's frame it clears the !REQUEST line.
		\item When the STM32 has finished reading a complete frame it clears the !READY line.
		\item The frame is transferred through SPI.
		\item This needs to be done this way because Raspberry can not be the SPI slave.
		\item Double buffered mode can be implemented (interrupting the current frame capture and send the latest fully captured one) but was not because software "DCMI" is a temporal solution.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Integration and communication work.
	\item However due to the very high image noise vision algorithms were not even attempted.
\end{itemize}
