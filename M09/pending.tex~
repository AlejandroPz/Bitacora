\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Turn line detection onto lane detection:} Add appropiate discrimination rules to get the lane.
	\item \textbf{GPU communication and shader programming:} Test shaders are working but the ones that give approximate solutions to the problem must be written, using the camera as the input is also yet to be written.
	\item \textbf{Mechanical camera mount.}
\end{itemize}
